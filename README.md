# paynow
Dead simple payment solution for the common man. 

## The problem 
most fintech solutions in Nigeria utilize app-based products, which means that they are not accessible to most average and below-average people in Nigeria,
because the majority of these people do not have smartphones.

## The Solution 
Paynow enables people to easily make payments using USSD.
They can access fintech services with their not-so-smart phones and enjoy the benefits of the digital economy.
